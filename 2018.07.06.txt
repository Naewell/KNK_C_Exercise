Chpater 6. Exercise

1. What output does the following program fragment produce?
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int i = 1;
	while (i <= 128) {
		printf("%d\n", i);
		i *= 2;
	}

	system("pause");
	return 0;
} 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128

2. What output does the following program fragment produce?
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int i = 9384;
	do {
		printf("%d\n", i);
		i =i / 10;
	} while (i > 0);

	system("pause");
	return 0;
} 9384 938 93 9

3. What output does the following program fragment produce?

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int i, j;
	for (i = 5, j = i - 1; i > 0, j > 0; --i, j = i - 1)
		printf("%d\n", i);
	system("pause");
	return 0;
} 5 4 3 2

4. Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that
the loop bodies are the same)?

(a) for (i=0;i<10;i++)
(b) for (i=0;i<10;++i) <-
(c) for (i=0;i++<10;)

5. Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that
the loop bodies are the same)?

(a) while (i<10)
(b) for(;i<10;)
(c) do ... while (i<10); <-

6. Translate the program fragment of Exercise 1 into a single for statement.

7. Translate the program fragment of Exercise 2 into a single for statement.

8. What output does the following for statement produce?

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int i;
	for (i = 10; i > -1; i /= 2)
		printf("%d", i++);

	system("pause");
	return 0;
} 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111...

9. Translate the for statement of Exercise 8 into an equivalent while statement. You will
need one statement in addition to the while loop itself.

10. Show how to replace a continue statement by an equivalent goto statement.

11. What output does the following program fragment produce?

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int i;
	int sum = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		if (i % 2)
			continue;
		sum += i;
	}
	printf("%d\n", sum);

	system("pause");
	return 0;
} 20

12. The following "prime-testing" loop appeared in Section 6.4 as an example:

13. Rewrite the following loop so that its body is empty:

14. FInd the error in the following program fragment and fix it.

if (n%2==0); remove ;
