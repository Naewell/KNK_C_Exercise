2. Which of the following are not legal constants in C? Classify each legal constant
as either integer or floating-point.
(a) 010E2
(b) 32.1E+5
(c) 0790
(d) 100_000 <-
(e) 3. 978e-2

3. Which of the following are not legal types in C?
(a) short unsigned int
(b) short float
(c) long double <-
(d) unsigned long

4. If c is a variable of type char, which one of the following statements is illegal?
(a) i += c;
(b) c = 2 * c - 1;
(c) putchar(c);
(d) printf(c); <-

5. Which one of the following is not a legal way to write the number 65?
(a) 'A'
(b) 0b1000001
(c) 0101 <-
(d) 0x41

6. For each of the following items of data, specify which one of the types char, short, int, or long is the
smallest one guaranteed to be large enough to store the item.
(a) Days in a month int
(b) Days in a year int 
(c) Minutes in a day long
(d) Seconds in a day long

7. For each of the following character escapes, give the equivalent octal escape. You may wish to consult
Appendix E, which lists the numerical codes for ASCII characters.
(a) \b
(b) \n
(C) \r
(d) \t

8. Repeat Exercise 7, but give the equivalent hexadecimal escape.

9. Suppose that i and j are variables of type int. What is the type of the expression i/j + 'a'?
-> ?

10. Suppose that i is a variable of type int, j is a variable of type long, and k is a variable of type
unsigned int. What is the type of the expression i + (int) j * k?
-> int

11. Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a variable of type float, and d is a variable of type double.
What is the type of the expression i * f / d? 
-> 실수나옴

12. Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a variable of type float, and d is a variable of type
double. Explain what conversions take place during the execution of the following statement:d=i+f;l
-> 정수만 계산 소수점 뒤엔 결과값이 안나옴

13. Assume that a program contains the following declarations:
char c = '\1';
short s = 2;
int i = -3;
long m = 5;
float f = 6.5f;
double d = 7.5;
Give the value and the type of each expression listed below.
(a) c * i = -3
(b) s + m  = 7
(c) f / c = 6
(d) d / s = 3.25
(e) f - d = -1
(f) (int) f = 6

14. Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of f correctly (assuming that
f and frac+part are float variables)?
frac+part = f - (int) f;
If not, what's the problem?

15. Use typedef to create types named Int8, Int16, and Int 32. Define the types so that they
represent 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integers on your machine.
