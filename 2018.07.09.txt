Chapter 6. Programming Projects

1. Wirte a program that finds the largest in a series of numbers entered by the user. The program must prompt the user
to enter numbers one by one. When the user enters 0 or a negative number, the program must display the largest nonnegative
number entered:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int n, i, max = 0;

	for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
	{
		printf("Enter a number: ");
		scanf_s("%d", &n);
		if (n > max)
			max = n;
		if (n == 0)
			break;
	}
	printf("%d", max);
	system("pause");
	return 0;
}

2. Wirte a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates and displays their greatest common divisor

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int a, b, i,div;

	printf("Enter two integers: ");
	scanf_s("%d %d", &a, &b);

	if (a > b)
	{
		for (i = 1; i <= a; i++)
			if (a%i == 0 && b%i == 0)
				div = i;
	}

	if (b > a)
	{
		for (i = 1; i <= b; i++)
			if (a%i == 0 && b%i == 0)
				div = i;
	}
	printf("Greatest comon divisor:%d", div);

	system("pause");
	return 0;
}

3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a fraction, then reduces the fraction to lowest terms:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int a, b, i,div;

	printf("Enter two integers: ");
	scanf_s("%d %d", &a, &b);

	if (a > b)
	{
		for (i = 1; i <= a; i++)
			if (a%i == 0 && b%i == 0)
				div = i;
	}

	if (b > a)
	{
		for (i = 1; i <= b; i++)
			if (a%i == 0 && b%i == 0)
				div = i;
	}
	int A, B;
	printf("Enter a fraction: ");
	scanf_s("%d/%d", &a, &b);
	A = a / div;
	B = b / div;
	printf("In lowest terms: %d/%d", A,B);

	system("pause");
	return 0;
} 

4. Add a loop to the broker.c program of Section 5.2 so that the user can enter more than one trade and the program will
calculate the commission on each. The program should terminate when the user enters 0 as the trade value:

5. Programming Project 1 in Chapter 4 askedd you to write a program that displays a two-digit number with its digit
reversed. Generalize the program so that the number can have one, tow, three, or more digits.

6. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number n, then prints all even squares between 1 and n. For example,
if the user inters 100, the program should print the following:

7. Rearrange the squre3.c program so that the for loop initializes i, tests i, and increments i. Don't rewrite the program;
in particular, don't use any multiplications.

8. Write a program that prints a one-month calendar. The user specifices the number of days in the month and the day of the
week on which the month begins:

9. Programming Project 8 in Chapter 2 asked you to write a program that calculates the remaining balance on a loan 
after the first, second, and third monthly payments. Modify the program so that it also asks the user to enter the number
of payments and then displays the balance remaining after each of these payments.

10. Programming Project 9 in Chapter 5 asked you to write a program that determines which of two dates comes earlier
on the calendar. Generalize the program so that the user may enter any number of dates. The user will enter 0/0/0 to
indicate that no more dates will be entered:

11. The value of the mathematical constant  e can be expressed as an infinite series:
e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3!+...
Write a program that approximates e by computing the value of 
1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!
where n is an integer entered by the user.

12. Modify Programming Project 11 so that the program continues adding terms until the current term becomes less than
e, where e is a small (floating-point) number entered by the user.
